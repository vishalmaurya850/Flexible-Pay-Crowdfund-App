A valid human readable address e.g. `cosmos1...` 2. A valid Andromeda VFS path e.g. `/home/user/app/component`\n\nVFS paths can be local in the case of an app and can be done by referencing `./component` they can also contain protocols for cross chain communication. A VFS path is usually structured as so:\n\n`<protocol>://<chain (required if ibc used)>/<path>` or `ibc://cosmoshub-4/user/app/component`",
